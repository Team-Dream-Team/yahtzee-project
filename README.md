Welcome to Yatszee! This game will be able to accomodate the needs of any number of multiplayers. You will be rolling the five dice
to try to fulfill different methods of scoring from large straight (five consecutive numbers) to full house (three matching numbers
with another pair of numbers). The number of players and methods of scoring will be in the player class while the logistics of the game and how the game runs step by step will be done through the main code. 


###### **Yatszee**

  "Welcome to Yatszee! How many players are playing the game?" (Command line argument)
  Use this to determine how many players we need for the player class to work.
  
  ## While loop 3 times. 
  "Enter Player 1 name"
  
  "Enter Player 2 name"
  
  Player 1 rolls...
  
  Display five numbers in the 2d array. 
  
  "Do you want to roll again? 
  
  "Which number do you want to remove?"
  
  Remove numbers and enter numbers one by one. 
  
  While loop of this...
  ## If player doesn't want to roll again or can't roll again, categories and methods for scoring will be revealed. 
  
  Based on what the player responds to the command argument, a method of scoring will be removed from the 'method of scoring list'.
  
  Update scores for players using the player class when the 'scoring method' is entered into the command line. 
  
  Repeat these procedures as many times as needed while alternating players.
